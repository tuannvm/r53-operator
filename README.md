# r53-operator

**NOTE**: This is an alpha-status project. We do regular tests on the code and functionality, but we can not assure a production-ready stability.

route53 Operator creates/configures/manages route53-failovers atop Kubernetes.

## Requirements

route53 operator is meant to be run on Kubernetes 1.8+.
All dependecies have been vendored, so there's no need to any additional download.
